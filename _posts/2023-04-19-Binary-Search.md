**An appropriate way to teach Binary Searcha**

When I was reading the 1st chapter of *Genetic Algorithms with Python*, the scene of the algorithm class appeared in my head. I was a sophomore at that time.

My teacher was teaching binary search algorithms on that day. Some of the students could *find* the optimal method with $O(n\log{n})$ complexity without any hesitation. I was shocked by their acute reaction.

However, after reading Section 1.1 of the book I mentioned before, I realized that the class is not well designed.

If I were the teacher, I would ask students a leading question first:
> What is the time complexity to search the fixed number if you only get the `Yes` or `No` answer?

And then, I would ask them the second question:
> What is the time complexity to search the fixed number if you get the `Higher` or `Lower` answer?

In this way, more students would realize the information entropy and learn how to utilize it. Next, I will attribute the thinking process to taking advantage of their knowledge of the problem space.
