* Those types are not "abstract"; they are as real as `int` and `float`.  -- Doug Mcllroy
* Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknownsâ€”the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tends to be the difficult ones.  -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Februray 12, 2002
* Give a man fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. -- Chinese proverb (English equivalent)
