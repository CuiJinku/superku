## Coffee machines

During the Black Friday on 2023, I almost bought a mass-market coffee machine, **the Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine, BES870XL**. ![picture of the Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine, BES870XL](../../../images/BES870XL_Transparent_1300x1300.png) 
The price of that coffee machine drops from $699.95$ to $559.95$ on the Black Friday. You can even buy the same model from Target with out-of-door price around $410$ with two coupons deducting $15\%$ and $20\%$, respectively. It is a much attractive discount!

However, after diving into the comparison and assessment of the other coffee machines, I realized the aforementioned machine is an entry-level product.

The exploration now turns my attention to the **Gaggia Espresso Machine**. ![picture of the Gaggia Espresso Machine](../../../images/NewClassic_Int_Varianti_Colori_Gaggia_2023-copia.png) There are thorough comparison available on the Internet. Simply put, the Breville machine is an all-in-one coffee maker. The Gaggia classic needs to be accompanied with a standalone grinder. But, it is worthy that you will get better quality espresso, much better streaming power, and the flexibility to upgrade the grinder.

When it comes to coffee grinders, I found two potential choices:

1. Model Ode Brew Grinder Gen 2 from **FELLOW**; ![picture of ode brew ginder gen 2](../../../images/ode-brew-grinder-gen-2.png)
2. Model **Sette&trade; 270** from **Baratza&reg;** ![picture of sette 270 grinder](../../../images/sette-270.png)


My roommate is more experienced than me in coffee hardwares. He bought both the **Gaggia Classic Evo Pro** and **Sette&trade; 270**. He has already gone through the pitfalls. As for the other grinder, **2nd gen ode brew grinder**, it becomes my alternative choice because I have seen it in a coffee store locates near to the Shenandoah National Park. The design of this coffee grinder really captivates me!
