## Quant knowledge

1. Strong Programming Skills: As a computer science PhD, you should already have a solid foundation in programming, but it is important to continue honing your skills, particularly in languages like Python, C++, and Java.

2. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: Machine learning and artificial intelligence are critical areas of expertise in the finance industry, as they can be used to develop predictive models and algorithms that drive trading decisions. You should aim to have a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms and techniques, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing.

3. Financial Markets: A solid understanding of financial markets is important for any role in the finance industry, including hedge funds. You should have a good understanding of financial instruments such as options, futures, and derivatives, as well as market structure, trading strategies, and risk management.

4. Big Data: Hedge funds deal with large amounts of data, so having experience with big data tools and technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and SQL is important.

5. Quantitative Modeling: Hedge funds rely heavily on quantitative modeling to drive investment decisions, so it's essential to have a deep understanding of statistical modeling techniques, time series analysis, and optimization algorithms.

6. Communication and Collaboration: Finally, it's important to be able to communicate effectively and collaborate with others. Hedge funds typically work in teams, so the ability to communicate ideas and work effectively with others is essential.
