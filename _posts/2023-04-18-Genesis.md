Initially, I want to save the development environment of my blog into a docker image, because I do not want to set up the development environment on the other machines if I want to craft a new post. 

Thanks to my navigator, friend, lab mate, and copilot, Yueming! He introduced Cloudflare can automatically generate and update his blogs. I believe it is quite similar to the GitHub workflow. 

I am a minimalist, and therefore I would like to spend less effort on tinkering with the developed environment and focus more on writing.

That is why I choose the GitHub workflow. I just create the blog repository from the [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) in the [GitHub skills](https://github.com/skills). It helps save a lot of time. I did not write any code about Github Workflow. It is already implemented inside the `.github` folder. Thanks for the shoulders of Githubants!

The blog inherits the default Jekyll theme `minima`. I only make some configurations in the `_config.yml`. There is a noisy sentence `subscribe via RSS` on my page. I do not want to clone the `minima` to my repo and then change it. Just leave what it is here. Whatever~
