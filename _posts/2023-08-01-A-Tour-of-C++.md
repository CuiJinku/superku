## Preface


## 1 The Basics

* Most readers will find useful tutorial and overview videos from conferences such as **CppCon** and **Meeting C++**. For technical details of the language and library offered by the ISO C++ standard, I recommend **[Cppreference]**.
* More advice about what constitutes good modern C++ can be found in the **C++ Core Guidelines** [Stroustrup,2015].
* troff: (**T**ypesetting **R**un**OFF**) A Unix utility that formats documents for typesetters and laser printers. Using a text editor, troff codes are embedded into the text and the troff command converts the document into the required output. 
* When we talk about portability of C++ programs, we usually mean portabilify of **source code**; that is, the source code can be successfully compiled and run on a variety of systems.
* The ISO C++ standard defines two kinds of entities:
    * *Core language features*, such as built-in types (e.g., `char` and `int`) and loops (e.g., `for`-statements and `while`-statements)
    * *Standard-library components*, such as containers (e.g., `vector` and `map`) and I/O operations (e.g., `<<` and `getline()`)
* C++ is a statically typed language. That is, the type of every entity (e.g., object, value, name, and expression) must be known to the compiler at its point of use. The type of an object determines **the set of operations** applicable to it and its **layout in memory**.

* A nonzero value from `main()` indicates **failure**.

* The operator `<<` (**"put to"**) writes its second argument onto its first.

* A strnig literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes.
