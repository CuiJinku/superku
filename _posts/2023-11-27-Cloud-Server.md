## Coffee machines

During Black Friday in 2023, I was tempted to buy a mass-market coffee machine, **the Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine, BES870XL**. ![picture of the Breville Barista Express Espresso Machine, BES870XL](../../../images/BES870XL_Transparent_1300x1300.png) 
The price of this coffee machine dropped from $699.95$ to $559.95$ on Black Friday. Moreover, you could purchase the same model from Target for an out-of-door price of around $410$, thanks to two coupons offering $15\%$ and $20\%$ discounts, respectively. This is was a very attractice discount!

However, after diving into comparisons and assessments of the other coffee machines, I realized the aforementioned machine is an entry-level product.

The exploration shifts my focus to the **Gaggia Espresso Machine**. ![picture of the Gaggia Espresso Machine](../../../images/NewClassic_Int_Varianti_Colori_Gaggia_2023-copia.png) Comprehensive comparisons are available online. In summary, the Breville machine is an all-in-one coffee maker, while the Gaggia Classic reqires a separate grinder. Nonetheless, it is worth nothing that with the Gaggia, you will get superios quality espresso, significantly better streaming power, and the flexibility to upgrade the grinder.

When it comes to coffee grinders, I have narrowed my choices down to two:

1. The Ode Brew Grinder Gen 2 from **FELLOW**; ![picture of ode brew ginder gen 2](../../../images/ode-brew-grinder-gen-2.png)
2. The **Sette&trade; 270** from **Baratza&reg;** ![picture of sette 270 grinder](../../../images/sette-270.png)


My roommate, who is more experienced in coffee hardware, has both both the **Gaggia Classic Evo Pro** and the **Sette&trade; 270**. He has already gone through the pitfalls. As for the other grinder, the **2nd gen ode brew grinder**, it has become my alternative choice. I came across it in a coffee store locates near Shenandoah National Park. The design of this coffee grinder really captivates me!

The Gaggia Classic Evo is an excellent choice for a first coffee machine, and there are definitely more professional options available when an upgrade is needed! I will update the post as I dive deeper into the topic.
